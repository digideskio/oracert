 A. SELECT DISTINCT DEPARTMENT_NAME, LOCATION_ID FROM DEPARTMENTS;
*B. SELECT DEPARTMENT_NAME, LOCATION_ID FROM DEPARTMENTS;
 C. SELECT DEPT_NAME, LOC_ID FROM DEPT;
 D. SELECT DEPARTMENT_NAME AS “LOCATION_ID” FROM DEPARTMENTS;

2. After describing the EMPLOYEES table, you discover that the SALARY column has a data type of NUMBER(8,2). Which SALARY value(s) will not be permitted in this column? (Choose all that apply.)
*A. SALARY=12345678 
 B. SALARY=123456.78 
*C. SALARY=12345.678
 D. SALARY=123456
 E. SALARY=12.34

3. After describing the JOB_HISTORY table, you discover that the START_DATE and END_ DATE columns have a data type of DATE. Consider the expression END_DATE-START_ DATE. (Choose two correct statements.)
 A. A value of DATE data type is returned.
*B. A value of type NUMBER is returned.
 C. A value of type VARCHAR2 is returned.
 D. The expression is invalid since arithmetic cannot be performed on columns with DATE data types.
*E. The expression represents the days between the END_DATE and START_DATE less one day.

4. The DEPARTMENTS table contains a DEPARTMENT_NAME column with data type VARCHAR2(30). (Choose two true statements about this column.)
*A. This column can store character data up to a maximum of 30 characters.
 B. This column must store character data that is at least 30 characters long.
 C. The VARCHAR2 data type is replaced by the CHAR data type.
*D. This column can store data in a column with data type VARCHAR2(50) provided that the contents are at most 30 characters long.

5. Which statement reports on unique JOB_ID values from the EMPLOYEES table? (Choose all that apply.)
 A. SELECT JOB_ID FROM EMPLOYEES;
 B. SELECT UNIQUE JOB_ID FROM EMPLOYEES;
 C. SELECT DISTINCT JOB_ID, EMPLOYEE_ID FROM EMPLOYEES;
*D. SELECT DISTINCT JOB_ID FROM EMPLOYEES;

6. Choose the two illegal statements. The two correct statements produce identical results. The two illegal statements will cause an error to be raised:
 A. SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID|| ' represents the '|| DEPARTMENT_NAME||' Department' as "Department Info" FROM DEPARTMENTS;
*B. SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID|| ' represents the || DEPARTMENT_NAME||' Department' as "Department Info" FROM DEPARTMENTS;
 C. select department_id|| ' represents the '||department_name|| ' Department' "Department Info"
from departments;
*D. SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID represents the DEPARTMENT_NAME Department as "Department Info"
FROM DEPARTMENTS;

7. Which expressions do not return NULL values? (Choose all that apply.)
 A. select ((10 + 20) * 50) + null from dual;
*B. select 'this is a '||null||'test with nulls' from dual;
 C. select null/0 from dual;
*D. select null||'test'||null as “Test” from dual;

8. Choose the correct syntax to return all columns and rows of data from the EMPLOYEES table.
 A. select all from employees;
 B. select employee_id, first_name, last_name, first_name, department_id from employees;
 C. select % from employees;
*D. select * from employees;
 E. select *.* from employees;

9. The following character literal expression is selected from the DUAL table: SELECT 'Coda''s favorite fetch toy is his orange ring' FROM DUAL; (Choose the result that is returned.)
 A. An error would be returned due to the presence of two adjacent quotes
*B. Coda's favorite fetch toy is his orange ring
 C. Coda''s favorite fetch toy is his orange ring
 D. 'Coda''s favorite fetch toy is his orange ring'

10. There are four rows of data in the REGIONS table. Consider the following SQL statement: SELECT '6 * 6' “Area” FROM REGIONS;
How many rows of results are returned and what value is returned by the Area column? (Choose the best answer.)
 A. 1 row returned, Area column contains value 36
 B. 4 rows returned, Area column contains value 36 for all 4 rows
 C. 1 row returned, Area column contains value 6 * 6
*D. 4 rows returned, Area column contains value 6 * 6 for all 4 rows
 E. A syntax error is returned.

LABS
1. Obtain structural information for the PRODUCT_INFORMATION and ORDERS tables.

	desc PRODUCT_INFORMATION ;
	desc ORDERS ;

2. Select the unique SALES_REP_ID values from the ORDERS table. How many different sales representatives have been assigned to orders in the ORDERS table?

	SELECT DISTINCT SALES_REP_ID 
	  from ORDERS ;

3. Create a results set based on the ORDERS table that includes the ORDER_ID, ORDER_DATE, and ORDER_TOTAL columns. Notice how the ORDER_DATE output is formatted differently from the START_DATE and END_DATE columns in the HR.JOB_ID table.

SELECT ORDER_ID, ORDER_DATE, ORDER_TOTAL 
 from ORDERS ;

4. The PRODUCT_INFORMATION table stores data regarding the products available for sale in a fictitious IT hardware store. Produce a set of results that will be useful for a sales person. Extract product information in the format <PRODUCT_NAME> with code: <PRODUCT_ ID> has status of: <PRODUCT_STATUS>. Alias the expression as “Product.” The results should provide the LIST_PRICE, the MIN_PRICE, the difference between LIST_PRICE, and MIN_PRICE aliased as “Max Actual Savings,” along with an additional expression that takes the difference between LIST_PRICE and MIN_PRICE and divides it by the LIST_PRICE and then multiplies the total by 100. This last expression should be aliased as “Max Discount %.”

SELECT PRODUCT_NAME ||' with code: '||PRODUCT_ID||' has status of: '||PRODUCT_STATUS as "Product",
       LIST_PRICE,
       MIN_PRICE,
       LIST_PRICE - MIN_PRICE as "Max Actual Savings",
       (LIST_PRICE - MIN_PRICE) / LIST_PRICE * 100 as "Max Discount %"
  FROM PRODUCT_INFORMATION ;

5. Calculate the surface area of the Earth using the DUAL table. Alias this expression as “Earth's Area.” The formula for calculating the area of a sphere is: 4πr2. Assume, for this example, that the earth is a simple sphere with a radius of 3,958.759 miles and that π is 22/7.

 SELECT 4 * (22/7) * 3,958.759 * 3,958.759 AS "Earth's Area." from DUAL ;

 This calculation approximates that planet Earth’s surface area is 197016572.595304 square miles.
